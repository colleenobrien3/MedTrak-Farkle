# MedTrak-Farkle Coding Challenge

## Description

Hello MedTrak Team! Thank you for taking the time to review my coding challenge! I began by making changes to fix some of the functional errors in the legacy code. However, once I progressed far enough to creat functionality for banking a person's score, I realized I should first refactor the existing code to be more modular so that the game could be played with multiple players. I figured this would be easier than continuing to write functionality for just one player and then at the end having to go back and refactor everything. So, I have created functionality to set a number of players, and I have fixed the buttons so that they shuffle only the correct player's dice.

## Technologies

- HTML

## Next Steps

Next, I would add functionality for banking the score! I would need to write logic for saving each player's score. I would also need to write logic to decide who wins the game. And of course, I would need to add styling to make it look nicer!
